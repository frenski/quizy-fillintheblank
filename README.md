[Demo and Documentation](http://fillintheblank.quizyplugin.com/)


### Usage ###

Download the [plugin](https://github.com/frenski/quizy-fillintheblank) and include all the necessary files before the closing body tag.

```html
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js" /></script>
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.17/jquery-ui.min.js" /></script>
<script src="js/jquery.quizyfillblank.js" /></script>
...
</body>
...
</body>
```
Add the css file to the head:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/quizyfillblank.css" />
  ...
</head>
```

Call the plugin after all the script files and before the closing body tag like this:

```html
<script>
    $('#tutorial-fillblank').quizyFillBlank({
      textItems:['Start of your text', '. text continues ', '. text continues here ', ', ... and here', 'and here it ends.'],
          anItems:['Answer1', 'Answer2', 'Answer3', 'Answer4', 'Answer5', 'Answer6', 'Answer7' ],
          anItemsCorrect:[2,1,4,6],
          blockSize:150
        });
</script>

</body>
```
The mandatory parameters you need to add are the textItems, anItems and anItemsCorrect. textItems is an array, which comprises the texts in-between the blank spaces. For example, if your text is 'The current president of the US is Barack Obama, who is a democrat. He was preceded by George W. Bush, who was a republican' and the blank spaces are for 'Barack Obama' and 'George W. Bush', this means you need to add into the textItem array as first item the text 'The current president of the US is', as a second item ', who is a democrat. He was preceded by ', the third ', who was a republican.', and so on... In the anItems parameter you set an array with the strings, listing the possible answers. In our case this will be some president names. In the anItemsCorrect we put the correct items and their position in the anItems array, ordered by the blank spaces in the texts. For i.e.: if we have anItems array: ['George W. Bush', 'Ronald Reagan', 'Barack Obama'] then for the first blank space the answer will be the third item in the array (with key 2, because the counting starts form 0) and for the second blank space the answer will be the item with key 0 in the anItem array. This means, the array for the value of anItemsCorrect parameter will be: [2,0]; Later on I will explain what are the rest of properties used for.

Create the html for it. It is pretty simple and shows where text and the answer should appear. You can put the two divs for the text and for the answers in different places depending on the layout of the page you are using.

```html
<div id="tutorial-fillblank">
  <div id="fillblank-text"></div>
  <div id="fillblank-ph"></div>
</div>
```
